# Testing Always-Active Command Line in Cortex

## What Changed

The command line is now **always active** - no need to press special keys to enter command mode!

### Previous Behavior (OLD)
- Had to press `Ctrl+O` or `:` to enter command mode
- Command mode was a separate state
- Had to press ESC to exit command mode

### New Behavior (CURRENT)
- Command line is always ready for input
- Just start typing to enter commands
- Special "/" prefix shows available commands menu
- Smart context switching:
  - Arrow keys navigate panels when command line is empty
  - Arrow keys edit text when typing in command line
  - Tab always switches between panels
  - F-keys always work for their functions

## How to Test

1. **Run Cortex:**
   ```bash
   ./target/debug/cortex
   ```

2. **Test Direct Typing:**
   - Just start typing (e.g., "ls") - it should appear in command line
   - Press Enter to execute the command
   - Command line clears after execution

3. **Test Navigation:**
   - With empty command line: Arrow keys move through files
   - Start typing something: Arrow keys now move cursor in command text
   - Tab key always switches between left/right panels

4. **Test Special Commands:**
   - Type "/" to see special commands hint in title
   - Type "/help" and press Enter to open help
   - Type "/exit" to quit
   - Type "/reload" to refresh panels

5. **Test Function Keys:**
   - F1: Help
   - F5: Copy files
   - F6: Move files
   - F7: Create directory
   - F8: Delete files

6. **Test Other Keys:**
   - Space (empty command): Mark/unmark files
   - Space (while typing): Adds space to command
   - Ctrl+U: Clear command line or unmark all
   - Ctrl+R: Rename (empty command) or refresh panels
   - ESC: Clear command line

## Key Improvements

✅ No modal command mode - always ready for input
✅ Intuitive context switching based on command line state
✅ "/" prefix for special commands (like Slack)
✅ All function keys work globally
✅ Tab always switches panels
✅ Better user experience - no mode confusion
