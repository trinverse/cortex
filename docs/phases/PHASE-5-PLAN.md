    cache: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<PathBuf, CachedDirectory>>>,
    max_entries: usize,
    ttl: Duration,
}

pub struct CachedDirectory {
    entries: Vec<FileEntry>,
    last_modified: SystemTime,
    last_accessed: Instant,
}
```

- `Ctrl+Z/Y`: Undo/Redo operations

#### 4.2 Vim Mode
**Goal**: Optional vim-style navigation

**Features**:
- Modal editing (normal, insert, visual modes)
- Vim-style movements (hjkl, gg, G, etc.)
- Visual selection mode
- Command mode with ex commands
- Customizable key mappings

### 5. Documentation & Tutorials (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 5.1 User Documentation
**Goal**: Comprehensive guides for all user levels

**Documents to Create**:
- Getting Started Guide
- Keyboard Shortcuts Reference
- Configuration Guide
- Plugin Development Tutorial
- Advanced Features Guide
- Troubleshooting Guide

#### 5.2 Interactive Tutorial
**Goal**: Built-in tutorial for new users

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct InteractiveTutorial {
    current_lesson: usize,
    lessons: Vec<Lesson>,
    progress: UserProgress,
}
```

**Features**:
- Step-by-step guided tour
- Interactive exercises
- Progress tracking
- Skip/resume functionality

### 6. Performance Profiling (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 6.1 Benchmarking Suite
**Goal**: Ensure consistent performance

**Benchmarks**:
```rust
#[bench]
fn bench_large_directory_listing(b: &mut Bencher) {
    // 100,000 files
}

#[bench]
fn bench_file_search(b: &mut Bencher) {
    // Search in 1GB of files
}

#[bench]
fn bench_archive_browsing(b: &mut Bencher) {
    // 1GB ZIP file
}
```

#### 6.2 Performance Metrics
**Goal**: Track and optimize key metrics

**Metrics to Track**:
- Directory listing time
- Search performance
- Memory usage
- Startup time
- UI responsiveness (frame time)

- Responsive UI at all times
- Intuitive mouse support

## Technical Requirements

### New Dependencies
```toml
# Performance
rayon = "1.10"        # Parallel processing
lru = "0.12"          # LRU cache
dashmap = "6.0"       # Concurrent hashmap
memmap2 = "0.9"       # Memory-mapped files

# Profiling
criterion = "0.5"     # Benchmarking
pprof = "0.13"        # CPU profiling
memory-stats = "1.1"  # Memory profiling
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
1. **Cache invalidation complexity**
   - Solution: Simple TTL + file watcher
   - Fallback: Manual refresh option

2. **Memory usage growth**
   - Solution: Strict limits + LRU eviction
   - Monitoring: Real-time memory tracking

3. **Mouse support complexity**
   - Solution: Incremental implementation
   - Fallback: Keyboard-only mode

## Deliverables

1. **Optimized Cortex Binary**
   - <10MB binary size
   - <100MB memory usage
   - <100ms startup time

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - User guide (PDF/HTML)
   - Quick reference card
   - Video tutorials

3. **Benchmarking Suite**
   - Automated performance tests
   - Regression detection
   - Performance dashboard

## Next Steps

1. Set up performance profiling infrastructure
2. Implement directory caching system
3. Add benchmarking suite
4. Begin optimization iterations

Phase 5 will transform Cortex from a feature-complete file manager into a polished, production-ready application that rivals commercial alternatives in performance and user experience.
