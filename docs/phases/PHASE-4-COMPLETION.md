## üìä Implementation Statistics

### Code Additions
- **Search Engine**: ~400 lines of search logic
- **VFS Architecture**: ~900 lines for virtual file system
- **Network Support**: ~600 lines for SFTP/FTP
- **Plugin System**: ~500 lines for Lua integration
- **Configuration**: ~700 lines for settings management
- **Dialogs**: ~2000 lines for various UI dialogs

### Dependencies Added
- `regex = "1.10"` - Pattern matching for search
- `zip = "2.1"` - ZIP archive support
- `ssh2 = "0.9"` - SSH/SFTP connectivity
- `mlua = "0.10"` - Lua plugin system
- `suppaftp = "6.3"` - FTP protocol support
- `tar = "0.4"` - TAR archive support
- `sevenz-rust = "0.6"` - 7Z archive support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Achievements

### Virtual File System (VFS)
The VFS architecture is a major accomplishment that provides:
- Unified interface for local, archive, and remote files
- Pluggable provider pattern for extensibility
- Transparent navigation across different file systems
- Memory-efficient streaming operations

### Modular Design
- Clean separation of concerns across modules
- Provider pattern for file system abstractions
- Event-driven plugin architecture
- Reactive UI with real-time updates

### Performance Optimizations
- Asynchronous operations for network and search
- Background task execution
- Efficient memory usage with streaming
- Smart caching for remote operations

## üîß Technical Highlights

### Search Implementation
```rust
pub struct SearchEngine {
    criteria: SearchCriteria,
    pattern_matcher: Box<dyn PatternMatcher>,
    results: Vec<SearchResult>,
}
```

### VFS Provider Pattern
```rust
pub trait VfsProvider: Send + Sync {
    fn can_handle(&self, path: &VfsPath) -> bool;
    fn list_entries(&self, path: &VfsPath) -> Result<Vec<VfsEntry>>;
    fn read_file(&self, path: &VfsPath) -> Result<Box<dyn Read + Send>>;
}
```

### Plugin System
```rust
pub struct LuaPlugin {
    lua: Lua,
    info: PluginInfo,
}
```

## üöÄ Ready for Phase 5

With Phase 4 complete, Cortex now has:
- ‚úÖ Professional search capabilities
- ‚úÖ Archive browsing support
- ‚úÖ Remote file system access
- ‚úÖ Extensible plugin system
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive configuration
- ‚úÖ Modern, responsive UI

## Next Steps: Phase 5 - Polish & Performance

Phase 5 will focus on:
