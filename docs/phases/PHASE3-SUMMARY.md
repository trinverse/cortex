## Key Improvements Made

### Architecture
- Modular dialog system for all features
- Separation of concerns (viewer/editor/filter logic)
- Reusable components and UI patterns
- Consistent keyboard shortcuts across features

### User Experience
- **F3**: View any file instantly with syntax highlighting
- **F4**: Edit files without leaving Cortex
- **Ctrl+F**: Quickly filter long file lists
- Real-time feedback for all operations
- Visual indicators for active modes/filters

## Usage Guide

### Viewing Files (F3)
1. Select a file and press **F3**
2. Navigate with arrow keys, PgUp/PgDn
3. Press **H** to toggle hex mode
4. Press **/** to search, **F** for next match
5. Press **W** to toggle line wrapping
6. Press **ESC** or **F3** to exit

### Editing Files (F4)
1. Select a file and press **F4**
2. Edit normally with keyboard
3. **Ctrl+S** to save changes
4. **Ctrl+F** to search
5. **Ctrl+R** to replace
6. **Ctrl+Z/Y** for undo/redo
7. Press **ESC** or **F4** to exit

### Quick Filter (Ctrl+F)
1. Press **Ctrl+F** in any panel
2. Type to filter files in real-time
3. Press **Enter** to apply filter
4. Press **ESC** to cancel and clear filter
5. Filter stays active until cleared

## Technical Details

### New Modules Added
```rust
// Viewer components
cortex-tui/src/viewer.rs         // Core viewer logic
cortex-tui/src/viewer_dialog.rs  // Viewer UI

// Editor components  
cortex-tui/src/editor.rs         // Core editor logic
cortex-tui/src/editor_dialog.rs  // Editor UI

// Filter components
cortex-tui/src/filter_dialog.rs  // Filter UI
```

### State Management Updates
- Added `filtered_entries` to `PanelState`
- Added `filter` field to track active filters
- Smart entry selection based on filter state
- Methods: `apply_filter()`, `clear_filter()`, `get_visible_entries()`

### Dialog System Extensions
```rust
pub enum Dialog {
    // ... existing dialogs
    Viewer(ViewerDialog),  // F3
    Editor(EditorDialog),  // F4
    Filter(FilterDialog),  // Ctrl+F
}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Viewer**: Loads content in chunks, suitable for large files
2. **Editor**: Maintains undo/redo stack with size limits
3. **Filter**: Real-time filtering with efficient string matching
4. **Memory**: All features use streaming/chunking for large data

## Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Key | Function | Context |
|-----|----------|---------|
| F3 | View file | File selected |
| F4 | Edit file | File selected |
| Ctrl+F | Quick filter | Any panel |
| Ctrl+S | Save | Editor |
| Ctrl+Z | Undo | Editor |
| Ctrl+Y | Redo | Editor |
| / | Search | Viewer/Editor |
| H | Hex mode | Viewer |
| W | Wrap lines | Viewer |
| ESC | Exit/Cancel | Any dialog |

## Testing the Features

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run Cortex
./target/debug/cortex

# Test viewer: Select any text file and press F3
# Test editor: Select a file and press F4, make changes, Ctrl+S to save
# Test filter: Press Ctrl+F and type to filter files
```

## What's Next (Pending)

- [ ] Search System (Alt+F7) - Global file/content search
- [ ] Archive Support - Browse ZIP/TAR files  
- [ ] File Attributes (Ctrl+A) - View/edit permissions
- [ ] Quick View Panel (Ctrl+Q) - Preview in opposite panel
- [ ] File Comparison (F9) - Diff two files

## Notes

- All features integrate with the always-active command line
- Filter persists during navigation but clears on panel refresh
- Editor prompts to save on exit if modified (TODO: implement save dialog)
- Viewer supports both text and binary files
- All dialogs support keyboard navigation
