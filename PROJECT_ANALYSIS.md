## Summary

Cortex is an **ambitious and well-architected project** that combines modern Rust development practices with sophisticated file management features. The modular design, comprehensive AI integration, and embedded terminal emulation make it unique in the file manager space.

However, the project currently **cannot compile** due to missing method implementations in the main application structure. This appears to be an incomplete refactoring or development state rather than fundamental architectural issues.

The codebase shows **high technical quality** with proper async/await usage, comprehensive error handling, and modern Rust idioms. Once the compilation issues are resolved, this has the potential to be a very capable and unique file manager.

**Priority**: Fix compilation errors first, then focus on testing and documentation improvements.
